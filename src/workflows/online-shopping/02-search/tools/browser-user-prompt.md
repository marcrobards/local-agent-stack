You have access to Browser Use — an AI-powered browser automation API.
Use it to navigate websites, scrape data, fill forms, run searches,
extract structured information, and complete any web task autonomously.

# Browser Use Cloud

> SDK and API for AI-powered browser automation. Custom models, stealth browsers, CAPTCHA solving, residential proxies, and scalable infrastructure.

**Recommended: BU Agent API (v3)** — more accurate agents, long-running tasks, file uploads, and persistent workspaces. V3 is a superset of v2. Use v3 for new projects.

- Skills (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/guides/skills): Turn any website into a deterministic, repeatable API endpoint.
- Authentication (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/guides/authentication): Profile sync, secrets, and 1Password with TOTP/2FA.
- MCP Server (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/guides/mcp-server): Use Browser Use from Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client.
- Webhooks (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/guides/webhooks): Get notified when tasks complete.

## Tutorials

- Chat UI (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tutorials/chat-ui): Build a chat interface for browser automation.

## Tips

### Authentication
- Profiles & Secrets (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/authentication/profiles-and-secrets): Run tasks on authenticated sites using saved browser profiles and domain-scoped credentials.
- 1Password Login with 2FA (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/authentication/1password-2fa): Auto-fill passwords and TOTP codes from your 1Password vault during agent tasks.
- Social Media Platforms (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/authentication/social-media): Use browser profiles and residential proxies to automate social media and job platforms.

### Live View
- Embed Live View (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/live-view/iframe-embed): Embed the agent's live browser view in your app using an iframe.
- Human Takeover (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/live-view/human-takeover): Combine human judgment with agent automation in the same session.

### Parallel
- Parallel Extraction (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/parallel/concurrent-extraction): Run multiple extraction tasks concurrently with asyncio.gather or Promise.all.
- Shared Auth (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/parallel/shared-config): Run concurrent sessions that share the same profile and proxy.

### Data
- Structured Output (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/data/structured-output): Extract typed data from any website using Pydantic models or Zod schemas.
- File Downloads (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/data/file-downloads): Download files the agent saves during a task.
- Geo-Specific Scraping (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/data/geo-scraping): Scrape location-dependent content using residential proxies in 195+ countries.
- Streaming (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tips/data/streaming): Stream agent steps in real time as the task executes.

## Integrations

- OpenClaw (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tutorials/integrations/openclaw): Give OpenClaw agents browser automation with Browser Use — via CDP or the CLI skill.
- n8n (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tutorials/integrations/n8n): Use Browser Use as an HTTP node in n8n workflows.
- Playwright (https://docs.browser-use.com/cloud/tutorials/integrations/playwright): Connect Playwright to a cloud browser via CDP for full programmatic control.
